# Internship Task 4 â€“ SQL for Data Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Objective:
Use SQL queries to analyze and extract insights from a relational database using structured e-commerce data (Olist).  
This task focuses on SQL operations like filtering, joining, aggregating, creating views, and using subqueries to drive data-driven insights.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies:
- PostgreSQL 17.5
- pgAdmin 4
- DB Browser for SQLite (for CSV export)
- GitHub

---

## ðŸ—ƒ Dataset Source:
- **Olist E-commerce Dataset** (from Kaggle)
- Tables used:
  - `orders`
  - `order_items`
  - `order_payments`
  - `products`
  - `customers`
  - `sellers`

---

## ðŸ“„ Queries Covered:
This task includes 10 queries that demonstrate various SQL concepts:

| # | Query Description |
|--|--------------------|
| 1 | View sample orders using SELECT and LIMIT |
| 2 | Count total orders grouped by status |
| 3 | Calculate total revenue collected |
| 4 | Count of different payment types |
| 5 | Join orders with customers to analyze location |
| 6 | Find top 5 product categories by total sales |
| 7 | Get top sellers based on freight charges |
| 8 | Monthly trend of order count |
| 9 | Create a view to summarize total payments by type |
| 10 | Use subquery to find top-selling category |

---

## ðŸ§¾ Deliverables:
- âœ… `task4_queries.sql` â€“ SQL file containing all 10 queries with comments
- âœ… Screenshots folder â€“ Output images for each query
- âœ… Cleaned dataset in PostgreSQL format (CSV imported via pgAdmin)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Learnings:
- Working with real-world structured data
- Hands-on JOINs, GROUP BY, aggregates, views, and subqueries
- Cleaning and preparing data for relational databases
- Writing clean, readable, and optimized SQL queries

## ðŸ“¤ Submission:
This project was submitted as part of my **Data Analyst Internship** under the module **Task 4: SQL for Data Analysis**.  
All SQL queries are tested and validated in PostgreSQL.
